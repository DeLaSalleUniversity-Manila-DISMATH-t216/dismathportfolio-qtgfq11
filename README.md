#Week 1 (January 6, 2016)
- We we're introduced to a new subject DISMATH. We were told that this subject wouldn't be focusing on so much Math and that we will be using our heads so much here.

#Week 2 (January 11 and 13, 2016)
- I've learned that a proposition must be either true (1) or false (0)
- A logical deduction is a process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion
- An axiom is a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted or self-evidently true
- I've also learned about these different kinds of truth:
(1) Legal truth (Judicial System) - decided by a judge based on evidence;
(2) Authoritative truth (Business) - specified by a trusted person or organization or your boss;
(3) Scientific truth - is confirmed by experiment but only specific falsehood can be demonstrated by an experiment;
(4) Probable truth - is established by statistical analysis of sample data;
(5) Philosophical proof - involves careful exposition and persuasion typically based on a series of small, plausible arguments.
- A mathematical proof of a proposition is a chain of logical deductions leading to the proposition from a base set of axioms.
- I've also learned about the different logical connectives which are, negation, conjunction, disjunction, exclusive or, conditional and biconditional
- We we're also taught on the first tool that we can use in proving which is the proof by truth table
- The second tool, logical equivalences were also introduced to us. These laws are identity, domination, negation, double negation, idempotent, commutative, associative, distributive, DeMorgan's, and absorption.

#Week 3 (January 18 and 20, 2016)
- The discussion about logical equivalences was continued. Examples were given to us to make us understand more about the topic.
- Quantifiers such as Existential and Universal were introduced
- Tautology was also taught, which simply is a statement that is always true
- This is the week where the forum about the presidentiables and vice presidentiables was held, that is why we had only one meeting this week.

#Week 4 (January 25 and 27, 2016)
- We were refreshed with the four tools that we can use for proving, the truth table, logical equivalence, quantifiers, and rules of inference
- Validity means that all its premises and the conclusion is true, otherwise, it is a fallacy.
- The rules of inference were taught, which are modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, disjunctive syllogism, addition, simplification, conjunction, and resolution.
- Modus ponens: (p^(p→q))→q
- Modus tollens: (¬q^p(p→q))→¬p
- Hypothetical Syllogism: ((p→q)^(q→r))→(p→r)
- Disjunctive Syllogism: ((pVq)^¬p)→q
- Addition: p→(pVq)
- Simplification: (p^q)→p
- Conjunction: ( (p)^(q) ) ¬ (p^q)
- Resolution: ( (pVq)^(¬pVr) ) → (qVr)
- Why do we study proofs? Debugging for software. Discovering bugs in the production for hardware.
- Direct proof, and indirect proof such as proof by contraposition and proof by contradiction, vacious and trivial proof, proof by equivalence were introduced to us.
- Direct proof has two steps: (1) Assume that p is true (p→q);
(2) Show that q is also true based on (1)

#Week 5 (February 1 and 3, 2016)
- First day of February was spent with DISMATH. On this day, we were introduced to the next method of proof, Contraposition. Contraposition can be done by first assuming that ¬q = T. Second is, show that ¬p is also true, based on your first assumption.
- Some examples were shown to us like proving that if n is an integer and 3n+2 is odd, then n is odd. We need to prove that p→q=T.
- The next method of proof which is Vacuous proof was also taught to us. This is when you prove that p is false because we know that when p is false, then p→q is true.
- Trivial is the partner of Vacuous proof. This is where you prove that q is true, because when q is true, then p→q is true.
- Next method of proof is Proof by Contradiction. It is done by proving that ¬(premise) is true. Then showing that it will end up with a contradiction.
- On that day, I was also reviewed with what a rational number is.
- We were also taught with Negation of Implication, and Contradictions and Implications.
- The last method of proof was taught too, which is the Proof by Equivalence. This is where you prove a biconditional statement. To prove that p⇔q,  then you must prove that p→q and q→p are both true.

#Week 6 (Febrary 8 and 10, 2016)
- The first meeting for this week is the celebration of the Chinese New Year. No classes for this day
- Proving was continued on our meeting for this week. More examples were given to us to make us understand more on how to prove statements and premises.
- Mathematical induction was introduced to us. This is used when a sequence of propositions is to be proved. First step is the basis step. Prove that the first proposition is true. Next is assume that P(k)=T.
 
#Week 7 (February 15 and 17, 2016)
- More mathematical induction examples were given to us like, prove that P(n)=1+3+5+...+(2n+1)=n^2.
- Summation was also discussed, and the notation was showed to us.
- Recursive/Inductive Definition which is no longer a proof was introduced to us. There is still a basis step and a recursive step.
- Recursive algorithm, which is an algorithm that solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller input.
- Program correctness as well as Program Verification was taught to us.
- Power Series was also introduced to us.

#Week 8 (February 22 and 24, 2016)
- The first meeting for the week was called off because of the quiz made Friday of the previous week.
- Sets were discussed to us.
- Set theory was introduced. Set Builder Notation was showed to us as well as the Set Identities that are somewhat similar to the Rules of Inference.
- Subsets were discussed as well as Cardinality which is the number of elements that the set contains.

#Week 9 (February 29 and March 2, 2016)
- Functions, also called mappings or transformations was discussed to us.
- Image and range were discussed as well. Codomain and range were also differentiated.
- The types of functions were discussed, one-to-one function (injective), onto function (surjective), and one-to-one correspondence (bijection).
- One-to-one function is a function that never assign the same value to two different domain elements.
- Onto Function is a function with equal range and codomain.
- Algorithm was introduced already. Page rank is the most famous algorithm now.
- Pseudo code is a high-level description of an algorithm that uses the structural conventions of a programming language, but is intended for human reading.
- Preconditions and postconditions were taught as well. Preconditions are statements that describe valid input. Postconditions are conditions that the output should satisfy.
- The properties of algorithm are input, output, definiteness, correctness, finiteness and generality.
- Two ways of searching algorithms were taught to us. It is the linear search sample program which is a one by one search tool, and the binary search algorithm which is a little faster than linear search.

#Week 10 (March 7 and 9, 2016)
- Binary search was discussed to us. We were taught how iteration is necessary for doing pseudo codes, and how it will help us to see if what we did was correct.
- Bubble Sort Algorithm was also taught to us. This is sorting numbers according to order and it is arranged by comparing adjacent elements.
- Insertion Sort Algorithm was also discussed. This is done by comparing the first element and the second element and if the second element is smaller, place it before the first element and so on.
- Greedy Algorithm was discussed as well. This algorithm selects the best choice at each step.
- Growth of Functions is also discussed. It is often described using Big-O notation.

#Week 11 (March 14 and 16, 2016)
- More examples about Big-O notation were given to us. We now know how to find c and k for the said notation.
- Big-Omega and Big-Theta were introduced to us as well. Big-Omega is for the lower bound. Big-Theta is for both the higher bound and lower bound. The combination of Big-O and Big-Omega.
- Algorithm Time Complexity were also discussed to us as well as the complexity of algorithms. The different kinds of Algorithms were refreshed to us, and the drill is to find the Big-Theta of the following algorithms such as Linear, Bubble Sort, and Linear Search.
- Division (div) and Modulo (mod) Operator were also discussed to us. Division (div) is the quotient Q, and modulo (mod) is the remainder r. It is discussed to us that r should be always greater than zero so we knew now the trick for using these operators for negative numbers.
- The connection and the use of these operators was also discussed to us so that we wouldn't be wondering why we are discussing these.
- We also started discussing about Cryptology, which is the study of secret messages.
- Caesar's Encryption method was discussed to us which is done by shifting each letter three letters forward in the alphabet to make it secret. For example, Caesar's Encryption for DLSU is GOVX.
 
#Week 12 (March 21 and 23, 2016)
- No classes for this week, call off for Quiz 2 and Holy Week break.

#Week 13 (March 28 and 30, 2016)
- Graph Theory was introduced to us. Graphs are defined as discrete structures consisting of vertices and edges that connect these vertices.
- Its applications are for Networks, Job assignments, representing computational models, telephone network, social network and many more.
- The degree of the vertex in an undirected graph is the number of edges incident with it, except that a loop at a vertex contributes twice to the degree of the vertex.
- Hand Shaking Theorem was also discussed as well as Subgraph which has the same concept as subset.
- Euler Circuit and Path was discussed too, a Euler Circuit is where you can pass on every edge or bridge only once and get back to the starting node while a Euler path is simply just passing on every edge once not necessarily returning on the starting node. All of Euler Circuits are Euler Paths as well but NOT all Euler Paths are Euler Circuits...
- Hamilton Paths and Circuits are discussed as well. The difference with Euler is that, this time it is every node that you need to pass once only, and not necessarily passing on all edges or bridges. Path is simply passing on all nodes only once and a circuit, you need to return to where you started.
- Matrices of Graphs, Isomorphism of Graphs, and Euler's Formula are added as well. Euler's formula goes like this, r = e - v + 2.
 
#Week 14 (April 4 and 6, 2016)
- This is the last week of our DISMATH class.
- Petersen Graph was shown to us. We discussed whether it is planar or not.
- Homeomorphic means that the two graphs are similar graphs derived from elementary subdivision by deleting node and then recconecting it.
- Colored Graphs were taught as well. Coloring a simple graph is the assignment of a color to each vertex of the graph so that no two adjacent vertices are assigned the same color.
- Four Color Theorem was discussed. This is where the chromatic number of a planar graph is no greater than four. The chromatic number of a graph is the least number of colors needed for a coloring of this graph.
- Graph coloring was also shown to us and how four color theorem is applied to graphs.
- A tree is a connected undirected graph with no simple circuits. The end of trees are the leaves, which has no children.
- There is a theorem that an undirected graph is a tree if and only if there is a unique simple path between any two of its vertices.
- A rooted tree is a tree in which one vertex has been designated as the root and every edge is directed away from the root.
- An ordered rooted tree on the other hand is a rooteed tree where the children of each internal vertex are ordered.
- We also learned some properties of trees. (1) A tree with n vertices has n-1 edges. (2) A full m-ary three with i internal vertices contains n = mi + 1 vertices. (3) A full m-ary tree with (i) n vertices has i = (n-1)/m internal vertices and l = [(m-1)n+1]/m leaves, (ii) i internal vertices has n = mi + 1 vertices and l = (m-1)i + 1 leaves, (iii) l leaves has n = (ml - 1)/(m -1) vertices and i = (l-1)/(m-1) internal vertices.
- Binary Search Tree was shown as well as Tree Example-Linux Directory.
- Modeling Computation was discussed to us.
- Kasparov was introduced to us as well as IBM's Deep Blue and Deep Blue Junior. Kasparov is a Chess Grandmaster and Deep Blue is a computer made to play chess.
- Structures in models of computation include grammars, finite-state machines, and turing machines.
- Language and Grammars were discussed on how they are important to computers.
- Formal languages include English, Spanish, French and many more. Programming languages include Pascal, Prolog, C, and Java. Grammars on the other hand are extremely important in the construction and theory of compilers.
- Compiler is a program that reads a program written in a source language and translate it into an equivalent program in a target language.
- A common way to talk about words, numbers, pairs of words, and many more is by representing them as strings. To define strings, we start with an alphabet, which is a finite set of symbols.
- Automata theory was discussed as well. It is where (input,output) is shown through table which is the state diagram and by graph.
