#week 1
- We we're introduced to a new subject DISMATH. We were told that this subject wouldn't be focusing on so much Math and that we will be using our heads so much here.

#week 2
- I've learned that a proposition must be either true (1) or false (0)
- A logical deduction is a process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion
- An axiom is a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted or self-evidently true
- I've also learned about these different kinds of truth:
(1) Legal truth (Judicial System) - decided by a judge based on evidence;
(2) Authoritative truth (Business) - specified by a trusted person or organization or your boss;
(3) Scientific truth - is confirmed by experiment but only specific falsehood can be demonstrated by an experiment;
(4) Probable truth - is established by statistical analysis of sample data;
(5) Philosophical proof - involves careful exposition and persuasion typically based on a series of small, plausible arguments.
- A mathematical proof of a proposition is a chain of logical deductions leading to the proposition from a base set of axioms.
- I've also learned about the different logical connectives which are, negation, conjunction, disjunction, exclusive or, conditional and biconditional
- We we're also taught on the first tool that we can use in proving which is the proof by truth table
- The second tool, logical equivalences were also introduced to us. These laws are identity, domination, negation, double negation, idempotent, commutative, associative, distributive, DeMorgan's, and absorption.

#week 3
- The discussion about logical equivalences was continued. Examples were given to us to make us understand more about the topic.
- Quantifiers such as Existential and Universal were introduced
- Tautology was also taught, which simply is a statement that is always true
- This is the week where the forum about the presidentiables and vice presidentiables was held, that is why we had only one meeting this week.

#week 4
- We were refreshed with the four tools that we can use for proving, the truth table, logical equivalence, quantifiers, and rules of inference
- Validity means that all its premises and the conclusion is true, otherwise, it is a fallacy.
- The rules of inference were taught, which are modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, disjunctive syllogism, addition, simplification, conjunction, and resolution.
- Modus ponens: (p^(p→q))→q
- Modus tollens: (¬q^p(p→q))→¬p
- Hypothetical Syllogism: ((p→q)^(q→r))→(p→r)
- Disjunctive Syllogism: ((pVq)^¬p)→q
- Addition: p→(pVq)
- Simplification: (p^q)→p
- Conjunction: ( (p)^(q) ) ¬ (p^q)
- Resolution: ( (pVq)^(¬pVr) ) → (qVr)
- Why do we study proofs? Debugging for software. Discovering bugs in the production for hardware.
- Direct proof, and indirect proof such as proof by contraposition and proof by contradiction, vacious and trivial proof, proof by equivalence were introduced to us.
- Direct proof has two steps: (1) Assume that p is true (p→q);
(2) Show that q is also true based on (1)
