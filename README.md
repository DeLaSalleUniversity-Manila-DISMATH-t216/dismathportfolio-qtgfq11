#Week 1
- We we're introduced to a new subject DISMATH. We were told that this subject wouldn't be focusing on so much Math and that we will be using our heads so much here.

#Week 2
- I've learned that a proposition must be either true (1) or false (0)
- A logical deduction is a process of reasoning from one or more statements (premises) to reach a logically certain conclusion
- An axiom is a statement or proposition that is regarded as being established, accepted or self-evidently true
- I've also learned about these different kinds of truth:
(1) Legal truth (Judicial System) - decided by a judge based on evidence;
(2) Authoritative truth (Business) - specified by a trusted person or organization or your boss;
(3) Scientific truth - is confirmed by experiment but only specific falsehood can be demonstrated by an experiment;
(4) Probable truth - is established by statistical analysis of sample data;
(5) Philosophical proof - involves careful exposition and persuasion typically based on a series of small, plausible arguments.
- A mathematical proof of a proposition is a chain of logical deductions leading to the proposition from a base set of axioms.
- I've also learned about the different logical connectives which are, negation, conjunction, disjunction, exclusive or, conditional and biconditional
- We we're also taught on the first tool that we can use in proving which is the proof by truth table
- The second tool, logical equivalences were also introduced to us. These laws are identity, domination, negation, double negation, idempotent, commutative, associative, distributive, DeMorgan's, and absorption.

#week 3
- The discussion about logical equivalences was continued. Examples were given to us to make us understand more about the topic.
- Quantifiers such as Existential and Universal were introduced
- Tautology was also taught, which simply is a statement that is always true
- This is the week where the forum about the presidentiables and vice presidentiables was held, that is why we had only one meeting this week.

#Week 4
- We were refreshed with the four tools that we can use for proving, the truth table, logical equivalence, quantifiers, and rules of inference
- Validity means that all its premises and the conclusion is true, otherwise, it is a fallacy.
- The rules of inference were taught, which are modus ponens, modus tollens, hypothetical syllogism, disjunctive syllogism, addition, simplification, conjunction, and resolution.
- Modus ponens: (p^(p→q))→q
- Modus tollens: (¬q^p(p→q))→¬p
- Hypothetical Syllogism: ((p→q)^(q→r))→(p→r)
- Disjunctive Syllogism: ((pVq)^¬p)→q
- Addition: p→(pVq)
- Simplification: (p^q)→p
- Conjunction: ( (p)^(q) ) ¬ (p^q)
- Resolution: ( (pVq)^(¬pVr) ) → (qVr)
- Why do we study proofs? Debugging for software. Discovering bugs in the production for hardware.
- Direct proof, and indirect proof such as proof by contraposition and proof by contradiction, vacious and trivial proof, proof by equivalence were introduced to us.
- Direct proof has two steps: (1) Assume that p is true (p→q);
(2) Show that q is also true based on (1)

#Week 5
- First day of February was spent with DISMATH. On this day, we were introduced to the next method of proof, Contraposition. Contraposition can be done by first assuming that ¬q = T. Second is, show that ¬p is also true, based on your first assumption.
- Some examples were shown to us like proving that if n is an integer and 3n+2 is odd, then n is odd. We need to prove that p→q=T.
- The next method of proof which is Vacuous proof was also taught to us. This is when you prove that p is false because we know that when p is false, then p→q is true.
- Trivial is the partner of Vacuous proof. This is where you prove that q is true, because when q is true, then p→q is true.
- Next method of proof is Proof by Contradiction. It is done by proving that ¬(premise) is true. Then showing that it will end up with a contradiction.
- On that day, I was also reviewed with what a rational number is.
- We were also taught with Negation of Implication, and Contradictions and Implications.
- The last method of proof was taught too, which is the Proof by Equivalence. This is where you prove a biconditional statement. To prove that p⇔q,  then you must prove that p→q and q→p are both true.

#Week 6
- The first meeting for this week is the celebration of the Chinese New Year. No classes for this day
- Proving was continued on our meeting for this week. More examples were given to us to make us understand more on how to prove statements and premises.
- Mathematical induction was introduced to us. This is used when a sequence of propositions is to be proved. First step is the basis step. Prove that the first proposition is true. Next is assume that P(k)=T.
 
#Week 7
- More mathematical induction examples were given to us like, prove that P(n)=1+3+5+...+(2n+1)=n^2.
- Summation was also discussed, and the notation was showed to us.
- Recursive/Inductive Definition which is no longer a proof was introduced to us. There is still a basis step and a recursive step.
- Recursive algorithm, which is an algorithm that solves a problem by reducing it to an instance of the same problem with smaller input.
- Program correctness as well as Program Verification was taught to us.
- Power Series was also introduced to us.

#Week 8
- Functions, also called mappings or transformations was discussed to us.
- Image and range were discussed as well. Codomain and range were also differentiated.
- The types of functions were discussed, one-to-one function (injective), onto function (surjective), and one-to-one correspondence (bijection).
- One-to-one function is a function that never assign the same value to two different domain elements.
- Onto Function is a function with equal range and codomain.
- Algorithm was introduced already. Page rank is the most famous algorithm now.
- Pseudo code is a high-level description of an algorithm that uses the structural conventions of a programming language, but is intended for human reading.
- Preconditions and postconditions were taught as well. Preconditions are statements that describe valid input. Postconditions are conditions that the output should satisfy.
- The properties of algorithm are input, output, definiteness, correctness, finiteness and generality.
- Two ways of searching algorithms were taught to us. It is the linear search sample program which is a one by one search tool, and the binary search algorithm which is a little faster than linear search.

#Week 9
- Binary search was discussed to us. We were taught how iteration is necessary for doing pseudo codes, and how it will help us to see if what we did was correct.
- Bubble Sort Algorithm was also taught to us. This is sorting numbers according to order and it is arranged by comparing adjacent elements.
- Insertion Sort Algorithm was also discussed. This is done by comparing the first element and the second element and if the second element is smaller, place it before the first element and so on.
- Greedy Algorithm was discussed as well. This algorithm selects the best choice at each step.
- Growth of Functions is also discussed. It is often described using Big-O notation.
